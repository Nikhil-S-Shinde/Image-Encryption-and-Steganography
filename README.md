# Image-Encryption-and-Steganography

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective method of securing image data using a combination of **Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA)** for encryption and **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** steganography for concealing the encrypted data within an image.

## Features

- **Encryption and Decryption**: The project utilizes the TEA to securely encrypt image data.
- **Steganography**: The encrypted image data is hidden within another image using LSB steganography, making it difficult to detect.
- **Modular Code**: The code is designed to be the core concept, which can be easily integrated into a larger application, webpage, or mobile app.

## How It Works

1. **Encryption**: The image data is first encrypted using the TEA algorithm.
2. **Steganography**: The encrypted data is then embedded into another image using the LSB method, hiding the data in plain sight.
3. **Decryption**: The hidden encrypted data can be extracted and decrypted to retrieve the original image data.


**Note**: This code is designed as a proof of concept and should be further developed and tested before being used in production environments.

## Future Work

- **Integration**: The core concept can be adapted for integration into web pages, mobile apps, or other platforms.
- **Optimization**: Further optimization and enhancement of the encryption and steganography algorithms.
- **User Interface**: A user-friendly interface can be developed to make the tool accessible to non-technical users.
